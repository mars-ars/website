## Factory visit to Electropack PCB Manufacturing
`2024 Jun 22`

MARS Amateur Radio Society organized a visit to M/S Electropack Electronics, a Commercial PCB 
manufacturing unit at Guindy on 22nd June, 2024. About 20 members including SWLs participated 
in the visit.

Upon arrival on the site, OM P.Thyagarajan - 
VU2PTR, introduced Mr.Vellaichamy - the owner of 
the unit to all the members and briefed the purpose 
of the visit. Mr. Vellaichamy welcomed the members 
and described in brief the kind of activities going on 
currently and how the scenario was in the past. The 
factory was enjoying monopoly in the past with 
regard to PCB manufacturing and almost all the 
industries dealing with electrical and electronic 
gadgets were its customers. Even today it had the 
support of prominent customers. The unit was busy 
with double side PCB manufacturing in the past and currently it is concentrating only on single side 
PCB manufacturing according to customerâ€™s requirements.

The whole process of making a PCB starts from cutting the copper clad 
Glass Epoxy sheets to the desired size followed by cleaning the surface. 
Special computer software is used to draw the required circuit tracks and a 
master film is produced from the software. It is then screen printed to get 
the tracks on the already cleaned and cut copper clad Glass sheets thus 
enabling mass production of the tracks on the Glass Epoxy sheets. The 
unwanted copper portion of the clad sheets is then removed by etching 
with Ferric Chloride (FeCl3) solution. The process is fully automatic. The 
sheets are then dried and holes of different sizes are drilled to enable 
insertion of components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors etc. The 
PCB is now ready.

Mr. Vellaichamy, the proprietor of the firm was so 
enthusiastic that he himself led the entire team to each and 
every section of the unit explaining in detail the processes 
and the machinery operations. He also patiently answered 
with a smiling face, all the queries from the visitors. Though 
the unit takes care of producing bulk quantities of PCBs for 
commercial firms, Mr.Vellaichamy came forward to prepare 
and deliver even a single PCB for the ham community thus 
showing his interest and involvement in promoting Ham Radio.
He was ably assisted by the staff in charge of each section.
The visit came to an end around 12.30 p.m

On behalf of MARS Amateur Radio Society and the SWLs, the 
secretary of MARS Amateur Radio Society, OM N.Deepan - 
VU2DPN, thanked the Proprietor Mr.Vellaichamy and his staff 
members for taking the pain to explain the complete processes 
taking place in the factory. The members too felt very happy 
and expressed their full satisfaction for making that day a 
fruitful one.
