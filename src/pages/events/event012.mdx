## Technical Presentation - Antenna Mysteries
`2024 Nov 23`
`OM Rajesh VU2OW`

The last Members Eyeball QSO of the year 2024 of the MARS Amateur Radio Society was held on 
23rd November 2024, at 'Hall no.1960 of the Dept. of Chemistry, College of Engineering, Guindy, 
Anna University., Chennai, at 6.00 pm IST (1800 hrs).

After the initial chit chat, the formal meeting began at 6:45 pm with the President OM P.Thyagarajan, 
VU2PTR welcoming the gathering. He went on to inform about the successful filing of returns with 
the Registrar of Societies (ROS). He also informed us that so far 89 members had been officially 
enrolled in the society of which 18 were new members. He also gave a brief about the details of the 
proposed 'Field Day' event and the workshop planned for the members in the forthcoming days.

Then the Secretary VU2DPN, OM Deepan, introduced the 
speaker of the day, VU2OW, OM Rajesh and invited him to 
deliver his tech talk. Mr Rajesh covered various types of 
antennae used for High frequency and very high frequency 
operation. He explained in detail the construction of simple 
dipole with ladder line and its performance. He covered other 
types of antennae like vertical, J pole, G5RV, End fed, Delta loop 
and ground plane. The advantages of each type were brought 
out in detail. He explained the relation between the power 
transmitted and ‘S’ point at the receiver’s end. The use of 
antenna and direction of propagation was also explained by 
him. He showed pictorial lobe formation of various type and its 
effective radiation. The take away of the presentation by Rajesh 
for the members was the emphasis on putting up a dipole 
antenna with random length with focus on operating on all 
bands of HF using antenna tuners and low loss transmission 
lines, rather than struggling to put up resonant antennas with 
band restrictions. On higher bands, resonant antennas with special dimensions / loading coils for 
higher isotropic gains can be used. 

Subsequently, VU2DA, OM Manohar presented a memento to Mr. Rajesh. 
The meeting came to an end with a vote of thanks proposed by the secretary..
