## Workshop - TDOA Antenna Homebrew
`2024 Dec 29`
`OM Rajesh VU2OW`

On December 29, 2024, our society conducted a hands-on workshop on constructing "Time Delay 
on Arrival" antennas, specifically designed for fox hunting. The event took place at our registered 
office, where eight enthusiastic members gathered to learn and build their own antennas.

The following members participated actively in the workshop.
1. OM Aravind VU2ABS 
2. OM Arun kumar VU2BBF 
3. OM Rajaram VU2RJV 
4. OM Vivekanandan VU3CDV 
5. OM Amarnath VU3CUT 
6. OM Sampath VU2SAA 
7. OM Shivram Sagar VU3OVD 
8. OM Ravichandran VU3WAW 

### Inauguration and Welcome
The workshop commenced with OM Ram, VU2AB handing over the antenna kit to OM Raj,
VU2RJV, marking the official start of the event. Our President, OM Thyagu, VU2PTR, 
warmly welcomed the participants and provided an overview of the workshop. 

### Technical Session and Assembly
OM Rajesh delivered an informative introduction on the working principle of the circuit and guided 
the members through the assembly process. The participants worked diligently, equipped with their 
soldering irons & tools, and successfully completed the home-brewing within the allotted time

### Testing and Conclusion 
All assembled antennas were thoroughly tested, ensuring they functioned as intended. A Nano VNA 
unit was used as signal source for testing. The workshop not only 
provided members with hands-on experience but also offered a valuable 
opportunity for socializing, eyeball QSOs, and camaraderie.

### Acknowledgments
Special thanks to OM Rajesh, VU2OW 
and OM Deepan, VU2DPN for meticulously planning and preparing 
the kits in advance. The Secretary, OM Deepan, proposed a vote of thanks, 
bringing the event to a close. Members departed with their newly 
constructed antennas, eager to put them to use during ensuing Foxhunt event.
